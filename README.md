### Step 3:
Handwriting recognition from google vision is not 100% acuracte. We have ensured through tests that the accuracy remains acceptable by means of image preporcessing. To further ensure that the words and sentences are detected correctly, we recommend user to upload material that has been used to refer by students (Reference book, papers etc)
